	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multihop system is a promising way to increase capacity and coverage. In this paper, we propose an optimally joint subcarrier matching and power allocation scheme to further maximize the total channel capacity with the constrained total system power. First, the problem is formulated as a mixed binary integer programming problem, which is prohibitive to find the global optimum in terms of complexity. Second, by making use of the equivalent channel power gain for any matched subcarrier pair, a low-complexity scheme is proposed. The optimal subcarrier matching is to match subcarriers by the order of the channel power gains. The optimal power allocation among the matched subcarrier pairs is water-filling. An analytical argument is given to prove that the two steps achieve the optimally joint subcarrier matching and power allocation. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the largest total channel capacity as compared to the other schemes, where there is no subcarrier matching or power allocation.},

	abstract = {Diversity as a security mechanism is receiving renewed interest due to its potential for improving the resilience of software and networks against previously unknown attacks. Recent works show diversity can be modeled and quantified as a security metric at the network level. However, such efforts do not directly provide a solution for improving the network diversity. On the other hand, existing network hardening approaches largely focus on handling vulnerabilities and do not pay special attention to diversity. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to diversifying network services under various cost constraints in order to improve the network’s resilience against unknown attacks. Specifically, we first define models for network services and their relationships, diversification options, and the costs. We then formulate the optimization problem of diversifying network services under given cost constraints. We devise optimization and heuristic algorithms for efficiently solving the problem, and we evaluate our approach through simulations.}

	abstract = {This paper focuses on a comprehensive analysis of typical power line communication (PLC) pulses for sensing high impedance faults in power distribution networks (PDNs) when the pulse compression time-domain reflectometry (TDR) system applies. In this sense, closed-form expressions for the PLC pulses, namely Hermitian symmetric orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (HS-OFDM), impulsive ultra-wideband (UWB), and chirp spread spectrum (CSS), and their corresponding autocorrelation functions are presented. Also, parameters based on radar theory (e.g., range resolution, pulse compression ratio, reflectogram distortion, and maximum unambiguous range) are introduced to evaluate the usefulness of these PLC pulses for providing proper TDR measurements (reflectograms). A comparative numerical analysis considering frequency bands that comprise narrowband and broadband PLC systems, with a highlight on well-established regulatory constraints, is discussed. Numerical results show that the use of UWB pulses yields a larger number of reflectograms in a given time interval, while HS-OFDM and CSS pulses provide higher reflectogram quality and better resolution, under the same conditions. Also, narrowband PLC systems are suitable for the majority of PDNs, with the use of broadband PLC ones left for attaining high resolutions at short distances.}

	ABSTRACT = {Impedance mismatch that degrades signal power transfer and affects communication reliability is a major obstacle for power line communications (PLC). Impedance matching techniques can be designed to effectively compensate for the impedance mismatch between PLC modems and power line networks at a specific frequency or for a given frequency band. In this paper, we discuss the tradeoffs that need to be made when designing an effective impedance matching network. We also make a comprehensive review of previous state-of-the-art PLC impedance matching techniques and provide a useful classification of each technique. Finally, we discuss important issues (concerns) and provide suggestions for research directions deserving more attention. This review provides a useful guideline for researchers and manufacturers to quickly understand impedance matching principles and facilitate the design of an effective impedance matching coupler for PLC applications.},
